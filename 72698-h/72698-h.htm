<img alt=" " class="drop-cap" src="images/i_485dc.png" style="width:3em;">
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>Sir knowing how doubtfully all Allegories may be construed, and this
booke of mine, which I haue entituled the Faery Queene, being a continued
Allegory, or darke conceit, I haue thought good as well for auoyding of
gealous opinions and misconstructions, as also for your better light in reading
therof (being so by you commanded,) to discouer vnto you the general intention
and meaning, which in the whole course thereof I haue fashioned, without expressing
of any particular purposes or by-accidents<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> therein occasioned. The generall end therefore
of all the booke is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle
discipline: Which for that I conceiued shoulde be most plausible and pleasing, being
coloured with an historicall fiction, the which the most part of men delight to read,
rather for variety of matter, then for profite of the ensample: I chose the historye of
king Arthure, as most fitte for the excellency of his person, being made famous by
many mens former workes, and also furthest from the daunger of enuy, and
suspition of present time. In which I haue followed all the antique Poets historicall,
first Homere, who in the Persons of Agamemnon and Vlysses hath ensampled a
good gouernour and a vertuous man, the one in his Ilias, the other in his Odysseis:
then Virgil, whose like intention was to doe in the person of Aeneas: after him
Ariosto comprised them both in his Orlando: and lately Tasso disseuered them
againe, and formed both parts in two persons, namely that part which they in
Philosophy call Ethice, or vertues of a priuate man, coloured in his Rinaldo:
The other named Politice in his Godfredo. By ensample of which excellente Poets,
I labour to pourtraict in Arthure, before he was king, the image of a braue
knight, perfected in the twelue priuate morall vertues, as Aristotle hath deuised,
the which is the purpose of these first twelue bookes: which if I finde to be well
accepted, I may be perhaps encoraged, to frame the other part of polliticke vertues
in his person, after that hee came to be king. To some I know this Methode will
seeme displeasaunt, which had rather haue good discipline deliuered plainly in way
of precepts, or sermoned at large, as they vse, then thus clowdily enwrapped in Allegoricall
deuises. But such, me seeme, should be satisfide with the vse of these
dayes, seeing all things accounted by their showes, and nothing esteemed of, that is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[Pg 486]</span>
not delightfull and pleasing to commune sence. For this cause is Xenophon preferred
before Plato, for that the one in the exquisite depth of his iudgement, formed
a Commune welth such as it should be, but the other in the person of Cyrus and
the Persians fashioned a gouernement such as might best be: So much more profitable
and gratious is doctrine by ensample, then by rule. So haue I laboured to doe
in the person of Arthure: whome I conceiue after his long education by Timon,
to whom he was by Merlin deliuered to be brought vp, so soone as he was borne
of the Lady Igrayne, to haue seene in a dream or vision the Faery Queen, with
whose excellent beauty rauished, he awaking resolued to seeke her out, and so being
by Merlin armed, and by Timon throughly instructed, he went to seeke her forth in
Faerye land. In that Faery Queene I meane glory in my generall intention, but in
my particular I conceiue the most excellent and glorious person of our soueraine the
Queene, and her kingdoms in Faery land. And yet in some places els, I doe otherwise
shadow her. For considering she beareth two persons, the one of a most
royall Queene or Empresse, the other of a most vertuous and beautifull Lady, this
latter part in some places I doe expresse<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> in Belphœbe, fashioning her name
according to your owne excellent conceipt of Cynthia, (Phœbe and Cynthia being
both names of Diana.) So in the person of Prince Arthure I sette forth
magnificence in particular, which vertue for that (according to Aristotle and the
rest) it is the perfection of all the rest, and conteineth in it them all, therefore in
the whole course I mention the deedes of Arthure applyable to that vertue, which
I write of in that booke. But of the xii. other vertues, I make xii. other knights
the patrones, for the more variety of the history: Of which these three bookes
contayn three, The first of the knight of the Redcrosse, in whome I expresse Holynes:
The seconde of Sir Guyon, in whome I sette forth Temperaunce; The third of
Britomartis a Lady knight, in whome I picture Chastity. But because the beginning
of the whole worke seemeth abrupte and as depending vpon other antecedents,
it needs that ye know the occasion of these three knights seuerall aduentures. For
the Methode of a Poet historical is not such, as of an Historiographer. For an
Historiographer discourseth of offayres orderly as they were donne, accounting as well
the times as the actions, but a Poet thrusteth into the middest, euen where it most concerneth
him, and there recoursing to the thinges forepaste, and diuining of thinges to come,
maketh a pleasing Analysis of all. The beginning therefore of my history, if it
were to be told by an Historiographer should be the twelfth booke, which is the last,
where I deuise that the Faery Queene kept her Annuall feaste xii. dayes, vppon
which xii. seuerall dayes, the occasions of the xii. seuerall aduentures hapned,
which being vndertaken by xii. seuerall knights, are in these xii books seuerally
handled and discoursed. The first was this. In the beginning of the feast, there
presented him selfe a tall clownishe younge man, who falling before the Queen of
Faries desired a boone (as the manner then was) which during that feast she
might not refuse: which was that hee might haue the atchieuement of any adventure,
which during that feaste should happen, that being graunted, he rested him on the
floore, vnfitte through<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> his rusticity for a better place. Soone after entred a faire
Ladye in mourning weedes, riding on a white Asse, with a dwarfe behind her
leading a warlike steed, that bore the Armes of a knight, and his speare in the
dwarfes hand. Shee falling before the Queene of Faeries, complayned that her
father and mother an ancient King and Queene, had bene by an huge dragon many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[Pg 487]</span>
years shut up in a brasen Castle, who thence suffred them not to yssew: and
therefore besought the Faery Queene to assygne her some one of her knights to take
on him that exployt. Presently that clownish person vpstarting, desired that aduenture:
whereat the Queene much wondering, and the Lady much gainesaying, yet
he earnestly importuned his desire. In the end the Lady told him that vnlesse that
armour which she brought, would serue him (that is the armour of a Christian
man specified by Saint Paul v. Ephes.) that he could not succeed in that enterprise,
which being forthwith put vpon him with dewe furnitures thereunto, he seemed
the goodliest man in al that company, and was well liked of the Lady. And eftesoones
taking on him knighthood, and mounting on that straunge Courser, he went
forth with her on that aduenture: where beginneth the first booke, vz.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A gentle knight was pricking on the playne. &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>The second day ther came in a Palmer bearing an Infant with bloody hands,
whose Parents he complained to haue bene slayn by an Enchaunteresse called Acrasia:
and therfore craued of the Faery Queene, to appoint him some knight, to performe
that aduenture, which being assigned to Sir Guyon, he presently went forth
with that same Palmer: which is the beginning of the second booke and the whole
subiect thereof. The third day there came in, a Groome who complained before
the Faery Queene, that a vile Enchaunter called Busirane had in hand a most
faire Lady called Amoretta, whom he kept in most grieuous torment, because she
would not yield him the pleasure of her body. Whereupon Sir Scudamour the
louer of that Lady presently tooke on him that aduenture. But being vnable to
performe it by reason of the hard Enchauntments, after long sorrow, in the end
met with Britomartis, who succoured him, and reskewed his loue.</i></p>

<p><i>But by occasion hereof, many other aduentures are intermedled, but rather as
Accidents, then intendments. As the loue of Britomart, the ouerthrow of Marinell,
the misery of Florimell, the vertuousnes of Belphœbe, the lasciuiousnes of
Hellenora, and many the like.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus much Sir, I haue briefly ouerronne to direct your understanding to the
wel-head of the History, that from thence gathering the whole intention of the conceit,
ye may as in a handfull gripe al the discourse, which otherwise may happily
seeme tedious and confused. So humbly crauing the continuaunce of your honorable
fauour towards me, and th’ eternall establishment of your happines, I humbly take
leaue.</i></p>

<h2 id="CRITICAL_APPENDIX">CRITICAL APPENDIX.</h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dedication.</span> In <i>1590</i> the Dedication runs simply:—‘To the most
mightie and magnificent empresse Elizabeth, by the grace of God Queene
of England, France and Ireland Defender of the Faith &amp;c. Her most
humble Seruant: <i>Ed. Spenser</i>.’ The words ‘and of Virginia’ and ‘to liue
with the eternitie of her fame’, added in <i>1596</i>, give evidence of the growing
importance of the colony and of the increased self-confidence of the poet.</p>

<p>I. i. Arg. 3. <i>entrappe</i>] <i>entrape</i> <i>1596</i>. In the matter of double letters
I attach little weight to the evidence of either quarto. I cannot believe
(<i>e.g.</i>) that a scholar like Spenser could have written ‘oportunitie’ (I. ii. 41
l. 7); so with ‘entrape’ here, and ‘mishapen’ at I. vi. 8 l. 7.</p>

<p>I. i. 2 l. 1. But] And <i>1590</i>. The reading of <i>1596</i> brings out finely the
contrast between the ‘jolly’ appearance of the Knight and his dedicated
purpose.</p>

<p>I. i. 5 l. 1. So pure an innocent] and innocent <i>1590</i>: an Innocent <i>1609</i>.
<i>1596</i> makes ‘innocent’ substantive: and so <i>1609</i> took it, as the capital
shows.</p>

<p>I. i. 9 l. 6. sweete bleeding] sweet, bleeding <i>1609</i>. But Morris is probably
right in regarding ‘sweete’ as an adverb to ‘bleeding’.</p>

<p>I. i. 15 l. 6. poisonous] poisnous <i>1590</i>. <i>1596</i> is less shy of trisyllabic feet
than <i>1590</i>, and both than <i>F. E.</i>; and the second part of <i>F. Q.</i> than the first.
Other trisyllabic feet left full in <i>1596</i> but elided or contracted in <i>1590</i> will be
found at I. iv. 37 l. 6; II. ix. 17 l. 4; II. x. 34 l. 1; III. viii. 46 l. 9; cf.
also III. ix. 48 l. 6. (<i>Per contra</i> III. viii. 49 l. 1; III. xi. 28 l. 8.) Elisions
are proposed by <i>F. E.</i> but ignored by <i>1596</i> at I. xii. 32 l. 5, II. vii. 54 l. 8.</p>

<p><i>1609</i> elides vowels left open in the quartos, <i>e.g.</i> at II. ix. 52 l. 9; III. v.
50 l. 8; III. vii. 5 l. I. Cf. also II. viii. 3 l. 8; II. xii. 27 l. 4, for its
avoidance of trisyllabic feet.</p>

<p>I. i. 15 l. 7. shapes] Morris reports ‘shape <i>1596</i>’: not so in Bodl. or
B. M. copies. But ‘shape,’ in <i>1609</i>.</p>

<p>I. i. 20 l. 4. vildly] vilely <i>1609</i>. The omission of ‘d’ marks the
seventeenth-century editor.</p>

<p>I. i. 21 l. 5. spring] ebbe <i>1590 &amp;c.</i>: <i>corr. F. E.</i> to auale] t’auale <i>1590</i>:
<i>corr. F. E.</i> A good example of the relation of <i>1596</i> to <i>F. E.</i> The first
correction is ignored, the second accepted. But the second correction is
obvious, being required by the metre; it must have been made independently.
And this is generally the case when <i>1596</i> and <i>F. E.</i> agree. For the significance
of this ignoring of <i>F. E.</i> see Introduction, p. xvii. Excluding ambiguous
instances, I have noted forty-eight places in which <i>1596</i> thus ignores <i>F. E.</i>;
fifty-four in which they agree. But of these fifty-four only six at most are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502"></a>[Pg 502]</span>
significant, the rest being obvious corrections. These are I. vi. 26 l. 5;
I. vii. 37 l. 8; I. vii. 43 l. 5; I. vii. 47 l. 3; I. ix. Arg. 2; I. ix. 9 l. 5.
Whatever be the explanation in these instances—and it will be noted that
they all come close together—they do not invalidate the conclusion maintained
in the Introduction, p. xvii, which is based on the negative instances.</p>

<p>I. i. 31 l. 6. you] thee <i>1590</i>. The plural pronoun is more courteous
than the singular. There is a similar change of ‘thy’ to ‘your’ in
I. ii. 22 l. 5.</p>

<p>I. i. 48 l. 9. with <i>om. 1596, 1609</i>. One of the instances that show how
little use <i>1609</i> made of <i>1590</i>. See further on I. ii. 29 l. 2.</p>

<p>I. ii. 11 ll. 3 and 4. One of several instances in which the punctuation
of <i>1609</i> brings out the true meaning or construction. See Introduction,
p. xvii.</p>

<p>I. ii. 27 l. 9. so dainty] so, Dainty <i>1609</i>. The editor of <i>1609</i> wishes
to show that Spenser is quoting the proverb ‘Quae rara, cara’. The quartos
probably intend the same meaning.</p>

<p>I. ii. 29 l. 2. shade him] shade <i>1596</i>: shadow <i>1609</i>. On the significance
of this for the relations of <i>1590</i> and <i>1609</i> see Introduction, p. xviii.
Other instances in which <i>1609</i> ignores <i>1590</i>, supplying by conjecture a word
or syllable that has been omitted in <i>1596</i>, are I. vi. 26 l. 9 as a tyrans law
<i>1590</i>, as tyrans law <i>1596</i>, as proud tyrans law <i>1609</i>; II. v. 8 l. 7 hurtle
<i>1590</i>, hurle <i>1596</i>, hurlen <i>1609</i>; II. vi. 29 l. 2 importune <i>1590</i>, importance
1596, important <i>1609</i>; II. x. 51 l. 7 Both in his armes, and crowne <i>1590</i>, Both
in armes, and crowne <i>1596</i>, In armes, and eke in crowne <i>1609</i>; II. xii. 52 l. 9
Or <i>Eden</i> selfe, if ought <i>1590</i>, Of Eden, if ought <i>1596</i>, Or Eden, if that
ought <i>1609</i>; III. iii. 44 l. 5 foure hundreth yeares shalbe supplide <i>1590</i>,
foure hundreth shalbe supplide <i>1596</i>, foure hundreth shall be full supplide
<i>1609</i>; III. vii. 45 l. 1 the good Sir <i>Satyrane</i> gan wake <i>1590</i>, good Sir <i>Satyrane</i>
gan wake <i>1596</i>, good Sir <i>Satyrane</i> gan awake <i>1609</i>; III. ix. 13 l. 9 And
so defide them each <i>1590</i>, And defide them each <i>1596</i>, And them defied each
<i>1609</i>; III. xi. 26 l. 7 and with imperious sway <i>1590</i>, and imperious sway
<i>1596</i>, and his imperious sway <i>1609</i>.</p>

<p><i>1609</i> ignores not only the text of <i>1590</i>, but <i>F. E.</i>, in favour of conjecture,
as at II. viii. 25 l. 1 Which those same foes, that stand hereby <i>1590</i>,
<i>1596</i>, same <i>corr. to</i> his cruell <i>F. E.</i>, Which those same foes that doen
awaite hereby <i>1609</i>.</p>

<p>I. iii. 32 l. 9. Who told her all that fell in iourney as she went] told,
<i>1609</i>. The meaning wanted is, ‘Who told all that befell her’; and so
<i>1609</i> takes the line, as its punctuation shows. It is not impossible to
get this meaning out of the line as it stands; but the order is excessively
contorted, and I have suggested ‘all that her fell’.</p>

<p>I. iii. 36 l. 7. morning] mourning <i>1590</i>. The words are, of course, the
same; and I now prefer <i>1590</i>, for though Spenser uses ‘morne’ he would
scarcely employ so ambiguous a spelling in the participle.</p>

<p>I. iii. 38 l. 7. the] that <i>F. E. referring probably to this line</i>. As the
references in <i>F. E.</i> are to pages only, it is sometimes impossible to identify<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503"></a>[Pg 503]</span>
them with certainty when they concern words like ‘the’ and ‘that’. See
again on II. xii. 1 l. 6.</p>

<p>I. iii. 41 l. 9. swerd] sword <i>1609</i>. It is ‘swerd’ in all our copies of
<i>1590</i>, <i>1596</i>.</p>

<p>I. iv. 16 l. 3. hurtlen] hurlen <i>1609</i>. <i>1609</i> makes the same change at
I. iv. 40 l. 1 and II. v. 8 l. 7, as if ‘hurtle’ were unfamiliar. Yet it has
‘hurtling’ in I. viii. 17, IV. iv. 29; and ‘hurtle’ in II. vii. 42.</p>

<p>I. iv. 23 l. 5. seldome] seeldome <i>1590</i>, sildom <i>1609</i>. See Introduction,
p. v.</p>

<p>I. iv. 23 l. 7. dry dropsie. Upton’s conjecture, ‘dire dropsie’ (‘dirus
hydrops’), is worth noticing.</p>

<p>I. v. 7 l. 9. helmets hewen] hewen helmets <i>1590</i>. This is one of those
slight changes of order, made here for the sake of grammar, but more often
for the sake of rhythm, which reveal the poet’s own hand in <i>1596</i> more
conclusively than more conspicuous alterations. Others are recorded at
II. i. 18 l. 6; II. iii. 38 l. 4; II. v. 5 l. 9; II. vi. 3 l. 6; II. vi. 12 l. 9;
III. ii. 8 l. 5; III. ii. 30 l. 5; III. iv. 59 l. 5; III. v. 40 l. 4; III. xi.
4 ll. 4 and 9; III. xi. 22 l. 8.</p>

<p>I. v. 10 l. 6. Doest] Doost <i>1609 passim</i>. See Introduction, p. v.</p>

<p>I. v. 17 l. 5. can] gan <i>1590</i>. ‘Can’ (in the sense of ‘did’) and ‘gan’
are easily confused, and difficult to pronounce between.</p>

<p>I. v. 23 l. 8. <i>Nightes</i> children] <i>Nights</i> drad children <i>1609</i>. On the
significance of this variant see Introduction, p. xviii. Other instances in which
<i>1609</i> fails to recognize syllabic <i>-es</i> are I. x. 34 l. 8; III. vi. 6 l. 5; III. x.
46 l. 6.</p>

<p>I. v. 26 l. 6. am] ame <i>1590</i>. This is the one eye-rhyme of <i>1590</i> that
is generally avoided in <i>1596</i>. Otherwise, so far as I have compared them in
this respect, there is little or no difference; both are excessively addicted to
eye-rhyme. The current heresy on this subject is expressed by Puttenham
(1589):—‘It is somewhat more tollerable to help the rime by false orthographie
then to leaue an vnpleasant dissonance to the eare by keeping trewe
orthographie and loosing the rime.’ (<i>The Arte of English Poesie</i>, Bk. II.
ch. ix.)</p>

<p>I. v. 38 l. 6. cliffs] clifts <i>1590 &amp;c.: corr. F. E.</i> There is the same
correction in I. ix. 34 l. 6. Together they suggest that Spenser meant at
first to change ‘clift’ to ‘cliff’ throughout; but found that it would impair
the rhyme, <i>e.g.</i> in I. viii. 22 l. 5.</p>

<p>I. v. 45 l. 4. On the <i>1609</i> ‘woundez’ see Introduction, p. xviii.</p>

<p>I. vi. 23 l. 8. noursled] nousled <i>1590</i>. This change is systematically
made in <i>1596</i>, which uses ‘nousle’ in a different senses = nuzzle; cf. IV. xi.
32 l. 8. There is the same difference between the first quarto of <i>S. C.</i> and
later quartos.</p>

<p>I. vi. 26 l. 5. fierce and fell] swifte and cruell <i>1590: corr. F. E.</i> In
<i>Malone 615</i> these words are on a slip of paper, probably cut (says Mr. Bliss)
from <i>1596</i> and pasted over the original copy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504"></a>[Pg 504]</span></p>

<p>I. vi. 37 l. 9. hath] had <i>Grosart</i>: not so in any of our copies.</p>

<p>I. vi. 47 l. 8. to] two <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>. Morris assigns ‘two’ to <i>1611</i>;
but it is in all our copies of <i>1596</i> and <i>1609</i>.</p>

<p>I. vii. 37 l. 7. trample] amble <i>1590</i>. One of those changes of words which
reveal Spenser’s hand clearly in <i>1596</i>. A steed so spirited would not amble.</p>

<p>I. viii. 11 ll. 5-9. Closely imitated in 2 <i>Tamburlaine</i> iv. 3. Cf. Introduction,
p. xi.</p>

<p>I. viii. 21 l. 5. their] his <i>Grosart</i>, adopting a suggestion by Church.
But ‘their’ may mean ‘<i>Orgoglio’s</i> and <i>Duessa’s</i>’.</p>

<p>I. viii. 33 l. 5. sits] fits <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>. But ‘sits’ = <i>sied</i>, as in I. i.
30 l. 9.</p>

<p>I. viii. 44 l. 4. delight] dislike <i>conj. J. Jortin</i>. As ‘delight’ is repeated
by parablepsy from l. 3, the form of the word is not much of a guide in
emendation. Others suggest ‘despight’.</p>

<p>I. ix. 32 l. 7. nor for gold nor glee] nor for gold nor fee <i>conj. Church</i>;
cf. I. x. 43 l. 6. But the alliteration, if not the sense, favours ‘glee’.
Cf. VI. v. 39 l. 3; VI. vii. 49 l. 9.</p>

<p>I. ix. 42 l. 7. Morris reports ‘hold’ as in <i>1590</i>: not so in any of our
copies.</p>

<p>I. ix. 53 l. 1. feeble] seely <i>1596</i>: silly <i>1609</i>. I do not think that
Spenser would have tolerated a combination like ‘seely, fleshly’; and
comparison with I. vii. 6 l. 5 and I. vii. 11 l. 8, where ‘fraile’ and ‘feeble’
occur together in lines which this line was meant to recall, convinces me that
‘seely’ (= feelie) is a misprint for ‘feeble’.</p>

<p>I. x. 7 l. 8. simple true] simple, trew <i>Morris</i>. But see note on I.
i. 9 l. 6.</p>

<p>I. x. 20 l. 5. See Introduction, p. xviii.</p>

<p>I. x. 27 l. 6. The correction in <i>1596</i> (<i>v.</i> footnote) was apparently made
to avoid the ambiguity of ‘salt water sore’.</p>

<p>I. x. 52 l. 1. since] sith <i>1609</i>. See Introduction, p. vi.</p>

<p>I. x. 62 l. 9. As for loose loues are vaine] As for loose loues they are
vaine <i>1590</i>. The reading of <i>1596</i> eases the metre, and V. iii. 22 ll. 5 and 6
shows an exactly parallel construction. But the main reason for preferring
<i>1596</i> is the proximity of 62 l. 4 and 62 l. 8, which are certainly author’s
corrections. See Introduction, p. xvii.</p>

<p>I. xi. 3. See Introduction, p. xvi.</p>

<p>I. xi. 26 l. 6. swinged] singed <i>1609</i>. The quartos are right. The
form ‘swinge’ is wide-spread in modern dialect. Webster quotes the noun
‘swinge’ (= a singe) from Beaumont and Fletcher.</p>

<p>I. xi. 37 l. 2. yelded] yelled <i>1609</i>. Though I have hesitated to change
the reading of the quartos, it is probably a misprint. Spenser elsewhere has
‘yell’. The nearest parallel to ‘yeld’ is ‘befeld’ = befallen, IV. iii. 50 l. 3.
The true reading may, after all, be ‘yelped’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505"></a>[Pg 505]</span></p>

<p>I. xi. 41 l. 4. Nor <i>1609</i>: For <i>1590</i>, <i>1596</i>. I am no longer sure that
Spenser did not write ‘For’. There is a very similar confusion in V. vi. 26
ll. 5 and 6.</p>

<p>I. xi. 51 ll. 7 and 8. The original punctuation makes l. 8 refer to the lark.</p>

<p>I. xii. 7 l. 3. sung] song <i>1590</i>. Here <i>1596</i> forgoes the eye-rhyme
to avoid ambiguity.</p>

<p>I. xii. 17 l. 1. that] the <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>. The change may be Spenser’s,
but cf. 21 l. 7 where ‘the’ of <i>1596</i> is probably wrong and occurs in the same
line with a word in which <i>1596</i> is certainly wrong.</p>

<p>I. xii. 17 l. 4. note] no’te <i>1609</i>, <i>1611</i>. Morris reports ‘no’te <i>1596</i>’:
not so in Bodl. or B. M. copies.</p>

<p>I. xii. 28 l. 7. her] his <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>. The change may be Spenser’s.
Having personified truth as <i>Una</i>, he may have felt an objection to personifying
it here. But the misprint is not uncommon: cf. 40 l. 9.</p>

<p>I. xii. 34 l. 3. improuided] vnprouided <i>Todd &amp;c.</i>: not so in any of the
copies examined.</p>

<p>I. xii. 38 l. 3. frankincense] frankencense <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>. The spelling
‘encens’ was not yet quite extinct, and I now incline to think that the more
archaic form was deliberately introduced in <i>1596</i>. Cf. note on ‘vpsidowne’
at II. vii. 4 l. 8.</p>

<p>II. i. 1 l. 7. caytiues hands] caytiue <i>1609</i>. ‘Caytiue bands’ has been
conjectured, but perhaps needlessly.</p>

<p>II. i. 18 l. 6. did he] he did <i>1590</i>. See note on I. v. 7 l. 9. This
transposition seems designed to get another alliteration in ‘d’.</p>

<p>II. i. 34 l. 6. Grosart reports ‘steady <i>1590</i>’: not so in our copies.</p>

<p>II. i. 58 l. 4. fry] fryze <i>sugg. Church</i>. As a contrast is wanted to
‘melt’ in l. 3, there is much to be said for Church’s ‘fryze’ (<i>i.e.</i> freeze).
(The spelling actually suggested by Church is ‘frieze’, as in II. i. 42 l. 3, or
‘frize’, as in VI. x. 33 l. 9; but neither of these would so readily be corrupted.)</p>

<p>II. ii. 7 l. 7. chace] pray <i>sugg. Collier</i>. This is the first of those
substitutions discussed in Introduction, p. viii.</p>

<p>II. ii. 21 l. 1. cald] calth <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>. Changes of tense like this are not
uncommon in <i>1596</i>, but here ‘calth’ seems an error due to the following ‘forth’.</p>

<p>II. i. 34 l. 9. thought their] though ther <i>1590</i>. <i>1590</i> seems to be simply
a wrong division of ‘thought her’, which we should perhaps read.</p>

<p>II. ii. 42 l. 6. make] hold <i>conj. edd.</i> See Introduction, p. viii.</p>

<p>II. ii. 44 l. 4. introld] entrold <i>1590</i>: enrold <i>conj. edd.</i> ‘Enrold’
is more obvious than convincing: it is typographically improbable, and it
makes poor sense. The problem is complicated by the ambiguous rhyme
with ‘world’ and ‘told’, for which, however, cf. I. xi. 27 ll. 1, 3 ‘world’
= ‘extold’. I am not convinced that Spenser did not coin ‘introld’, though
I do not know what he meant by it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506"></a>[Pg 506]</span></p>

<p>II. iii. 4 l. 5. A pleasing vaine of glory vaine did find] A pleasing vaine
of glory he did find <i>1590</i>. It is natural to regard the second ‘vaine’
as a mere printer’s repetition of the first. But the collocation of ‘glory’ and
‘vaine’ appears in two other descriptions of <i>Braggadocchio</i>, <i>viz.</i> III. viii. 11
ll. 8 and 9; IV. iv. 14 l. 5. And the play on words is quite Spenserian;
cf. I. iv. 6 l. 6 array ... arras; II. i. 37 l. 9 leaue ... leaue; II. ii. 12
l. 3 fairely fare.</p>

<p>II. iii. 10 l. 1. On the spelling of <i>Braggadocchio</i> see Introduction, p. vi.
In the second volume of <i>1596</i> we find <i>cc</i> in IV. ii. 4; IV. iv. 14; IV. iv.
20; <i>c</i> in IV. iv. 8; IV. iv. 10; IV. v. 23; IV. v. 26; and always in V. iii.</p>

<p>II. iii. 20 l. 5. their haire on end does reare] does vnto them affeare <i>1590</i>:
vnto <i>corr. to</i> greatly <i>F. E.</i> It seems as if Spenser originally wrote ‘appeare’,
forgot this when he made <i>F. E.</i>, and in turn forgot <i>F. E.</i> when he corrected
the copy for <i>1596</i>; or knowingly changed his mind twice.</p>

<p>II. iii. 28 l. 7. play] sport <i>conj. ed.</i> See Introduction, p. viii. I do
not wish to <i>read</i> ‘sport’ in the text, as the form of the footnote might imply.
This substitution does not seem to have been noticed by previous editors.</p>

<p>II. iii. 38 l. 4. haue I] I haue <i>1590</i>. See note on I. v. 7 l. 9.</p>

<p>II. iii. 45 l. 4. one] on <i>1590</i>, <i>1596</i>. For the converse misprint cf.
II. i. 31 l. 4.</p>

<p>II. iii. 46 l. 9. erne] yerne <i>1609</i>. These two words are regularly
interchanged in <i>1609</i>, in accordance with modern usage. Cf. VI. vii.
15 l. 9.</p>

<p>II. iv. 17 ll. 6, 8, 9. A striking instance of author’s correction in <i>1596</i>.
Spenser seems to have shrunk from the forms ‘trech’, ‘ketch.’</p>

<p>II. iv. 35. This is the stanza quoted by Fraunce in 1588. See
Introduction, p. xi.</p>

<p>II. iv. 41 l. 8. A hexameter in the eighth line. It might be corrected
by omitting ‘is sonne’; but for this there is no authority. See Introduction,
p. vii.</p>

<p>II. v. 5 l. 9. do not much me faile] doe me not much fayl <i>1590</i>. See note
on I. v. 7 l. 9.</p>

<p>II. v. 8 l. 7. hurtle] hurle, <i>1596</i>; hurlen <i>1609</i>. See notes on I. ii. 29
l. 2 and I. iv. 16 l. 3.</p>

<p>II. v. 12 ll. 8 and 9. A very difficult passage. The meaning wanted seems
to be, ‘Do not think that it is thy force but the unjust doom of fortune that
has thus laid me low.’ This meaning comes more easily if we read ‘but’
for ‘by’: a conjecture in which I find that I was anticipated by a friend
of Jortin’s. But no good meaning can be got out of ‘maugre her spight’
without taking ‘maugre’ in the sense of ‘curse on’, or the like, which
it never bears outside <i>F. Q.</i>, if there. The nearest parallels are III. iv. 39
l. 8; III. v. 7 l. 5; VI. iv. 40 l. 3. See Introduction, p. ix.</p>

<p>II. v. 19 l. 7. do] garre <i>1590</i>. A very interesting change. Had
it been objected to ‘garre’ that it was peculiar to Northern dialect?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507"></a>[Pg 507]</span>
I believe that several changes in <i>1596</i> were made to meet such criticisms.
Spenser uses ‘garre’ in <i>S. C.</i>, but not elsewhere in <i>F. Q.</i></p>

<p>II. v. 29 l. 5. pricking] prickling <i>1590</i>. The quartos differ repeatedly
over this particular letter—cf. II. i. 31 l. 2; II. vi. 18 l. 7; II. xi. 13 l. 5;
II. xii. 30 l. 6 (where <i>1590</i> is certainly right). Here usage favours <i>1596</i>,
but sound <i>1590</i>.</p>

<p>II. v. 31 l. 5. See note on II. iii. 20 l. 5.</p>

<p>II. vi. 3 l. 4. that nigh her breth was gone,] as merry as Pope Ione,
<i>1590</i>. The earlier reading was apparently thought too colloquial.</p>

<p>II. vi. 3 l. 6. might to her] to her might <i>1590</i>. See note on I. v. 7 l. 9.
The authenticity of the transposition here is made probable by the proximity
of l. 4.</p>

<p>II. vi. 5 l. 6. cut away. We should perhaps read ‘cut a way’; cf. II.
viii. 5 l. 9.</p>

<p>II. vi. 12 l. 9. See note on I. v. 7 l. 9.</p>

<p>II. vi. 14 l. 9. loud] loue <i>1590</i>. The reading of <i>1596</i> is supported by
the proximity of II. vi. 12 l. 9.</p>

<p>II. vi. 18 l. 7. griesly] griesy <i>1590</i>. On the variants see note on
II. v. 29 l. 5. ‘Griesy’ is here explained as ‘sluggish’. But we find
griesie’, I. ix. 35 l. 4 (but ‘griesly’ <i>1611</i>); ‘grysie’, II. xi. 12 l. 3 and III.
xii. 19 l. 2; ‘gryesy’, III. i. 67 l. 7. These are all one word, and the
meaning is always ‘squalid’, ‘hideous’.</p>

<p>II. vi. 29 l. 2. importune] importance <i>1596</i>: important <i>1609</i>. See note
on I. ii. 29 l. 2.</p>

<p>II. vi. 42 l. 4. steept] stept <i>1590</i> should have been recorded in
footnote.</p>

<p>II. vii. 4 l. 8. vpsidowne] vpside downe <i>1590</i>. The original form, as
I learn from Sir James Murray, was ‘upsodown’ or ‘upsadown’; ‘upsidown’
became current in the second quarter of the sixteenth century; ‘upside-down’
appears first in Coverdale. By the last decade of the century ‘upsodown’
was obsolete, ‘upsidown’ archaic, ‘upside-down’ or ‘upset-down’ current.
There is little doubt that here, as at I. xii. 38 l. 3, Spenser deliberately returned
in <i>1596</i> to the more archaic form.</p>

<p>II. vii. 40 l. 5. that] the <i>1590 &amp;c.</i>: <i>corr. F. E.</i> <i>F. E.</i> might refer to
43 l. 2. See note on I. iii. 38 l. 7. The earlier stanza is quoted with ‘the’
in <i>England’s Parnassus</i> (1600). But the quotation is full of mistakes and has
no authority.</p>

<p>II. vii. 52 l. 6. With which] Which with <i>1590</i>, <i>1596</i>: Which-with
<i>1609</i>. At IV. vii. 25 l. 1 ‘Which’ is ‘With’ in <i>1596</i>.</p>

<p>II. viii. 3 l. 8. Come hither, come hither] Come hither, hither <i>1609</i>. But
the trisyllabic foot is probably genuine, and expresses agitation. See note
on I. i. 15 l.</p>

<p>II. viii. 25 l. 1. See note on I. ii. 29 l. 2.</p>

<p>II. viii. 29 l. 7. vpreare] vpheaue <i>MS. corr. in Malone 615</i>. See Introduction,
p. viii. Kitchin speaks of these MS. corrections as ‘co-temporary’;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508"></a>[Pg 508]</span>
and a note in the Bodleian catalogue ascribes them to Lord Burleigh. But
most of them are in a hand much later than 1600.</p>

<p>II. viii. 40 l. 4. so wisely as it ought] so well, as he it ought <i>1590</i>.
<i>1596</i> means, ‘As wisely as it ought to be used.’ For the construction cf.
II. viii. 32 l. 4; VII. vii. 9 l. 8. But <i>1590</i> gives an excellent meaning, ‘As
well as he who owned it’; and it is hard to see why Spenser changed it.
This is one of the few corrections that I suspect of being editorial. Cf. II.
x. 49 l. 8. A converse confusion of the two meanings of ‘ought’ is shown
by the variants on VI. viii. 50 l. 4.</p>

<p>II. viii. 44 l. 8. no more] not thore <i>1590</i>. ‘Thore’, if not a misprint
(and it does not look like one), was probably meant for ‘there’, as ‘tho’ =
then, rather than for ‘through’ (‘thorough’). In either case Spenser felt it
licentious.</p>

<p>II. viii. 48 l. 8. Prince <i>Arthur</i> <i>1609</i>: Sir <i>Guyon</i> <i>1590</i>, <i>1596</i>. See
Introduction, p. xviii.</p>

<p>II. ix. 7 ll. 5 and 6. The time is shortened to agree with I. ix. 15. Cf.
also II. ix. 38.</p>

<p>II. ix. 9 l. 1. weete] wote <i>1590 &amp;c.</i> Not an imperfect rhyme, but
a misprint; for the form is wrong.</p>

<p>II. ix. 17 l. 4. perilous] perlous <i>1590</i>. See note on I. i. 15 l. 6.</p>

<p>II. ix. 21 l. 1. them] him <i>1590</i>. It is ‘them’ in <i>England’s Parnassus</i>.
See note on II. vii. 40 l. 5.</p>

<p>II. ix. 35 l. 3. idly] idle <i>1609</i> should have been recorded in the footnote.</p>

<p>II. ix. 38 l. 2. mood] word <i>1590 &amp;c.</i> Collier credits Drayton with
the emendation (see on 49 l. 4 below); but Morris seems to have first
adopted it. There is a similar misprint of ‘word’ for ‘wood’ in <i>1590</i> at
III. xii. 7 l. 8.</p>

<p>II. ix. 38 l. 9. twelue moneths] three years <i>1590</i>. See note on II. ix.
7 above.</p>

<p>II. ix. 49 l. 4. reason] season <i>Drayton</i> (<i>teste Collier</i>). Collier professed
to have a copy of the <i>1611</i> folio that had belonged to Drayton and had
corrections in his hand. On questions of this nature no weight can be attached
to Collier’s unverified statements, and I am not aware that this statement has
been verified. The corrections with which he credits Drayton are often
ingenious, but not more ingenious than those which he puts forward as his
own.</p>

<p>II. ix. 52 l. 9. the house] th’house <i>1609</i>. See note on I. i. 15 l. 6.</p>

<p>II. x. 6 l. 6. safeties sake] safety <i>1590</i>. 7 l. 7. liued then] liueden
<i>1590</i>. Either of these corrections might be editorial; but by their proximity
they support each other.</p>

<p>II. x. 15 l. 9. munifience] munificence <i>1590</i>, <i>1609</i>. Spenser certainly
means ‘fortification’, and has either coined a noun from munify + ence, or
applied ‘munificence’ in this unexampled sense. The reading ‘munifience’
is found only in <i>1596</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509"></a>[Pg 509]</span></p>

<p>II. x. 24 l. 9. <i>F. E.</i> shows that <i>Seuith</i> was printed in some copies of
<i>1590</i>. Church, Upton, and Todd all had copies in which the missing words
were supplied.</p>

<p>II. x. 34 l. 1. <i>Riuallo</i>] <i>Riuall’</i> <i>1590</i>. See note on I. i. 15 l. 6.</p>

<p>II. x. 43 l. 1. <i>Sisillus</i>] Sifillus <i>1590 &amp;c.</i> We should perhaps read <i>Sisilius</i>
with Geoffrey of Monmouth (<i>Historia Britonum</i>, Lib. III, § 13: in § 14 he
spells it <i>Sisillius</i>).</p>

<p>II. x. 67 l. 2. <i>Ambrose</i>] <i>Ambrise</i> <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>. Geoffrey of Monmouth
(<i>Historia Britonum</i>, Lib. VI) supports <i>1590</i>.</p>

<p>II. x. 49 1. 8. defrayd] did defray <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>. Here at least the printer
of <i>1596</i> is seen to have assumed the editor. He betrays himself by losing
the rhyme-scheme, rhyming line 8 with lines 2, 4, 5, 7 instead of 6, 9. See
note on II. viii. 40 l. 4.</p>

<p>II. x. 51 l. 7. See note on I. ii. 29 l. 2.</p>

<p>II. x. 67 l. 2. <i>Ambrose</i>] <i>Ambrise</i> <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>. Geoffrey of Monmouth
(<i>Historia Britonum</i>, Lib. VI) supports <i>1590</i>.</p>

<p>II. xi. 10 l. 2. dessignment] assignment <i>1590</i>. It is the proximity of
the indubitable author’s correction in 9 l. 9 that decides in favour of <i>1596</i>.</p>

<p>II. xi. 11 l. 4. dismayd] mismayd <i>conj. Jortin</i>. Jortin’s ‘mismayd’
(<i>i. e.</i> mismade, miscreated) gives a good meaning, and the misprint is paralleled
at III. ix. 7 l. 3 disdonne <i>1590</i>, misdonne <i>1596</i>. Others think that
‘dismayd’ may bear the same meaning.</p>

<p>II. xi. 13 l. 5. assayled] assayed <i>1590</i>. See note on II. v. 29 l. 5.</p>

<p>II. xi. 21 l. 8. their] there <i>1609</i>. I should now prefer to read ‘there’
in all such cases.</p>

<p>II. xii. 1 l. 4. Formerly] ‘Formally’ is a conjecture of my own, and should
have been indicated as such in the footnote. It was suggested by II. xii. 81
l. 5, where ‘formally’ = <i>secundum artem</i>. ‘Firmëly’ has been proposed; but
that is impossible. The text may be sound.</p>

<p>II. xii. 1 l. 6. Others take <i>F. E.</i> to refer to l. 1. See note on I.
iii. 38 l. 7.</p>

<p>II. xii. 23 l. 9. Upton, Todd, &amp;c., keep <i>Monoceros</i>, scanning ‘immeasúrëd’,
which is without example. The reading adopted by Child was originally
suggested by Jortin.</p>

<p>II. xii. 27 l. 4. sea the resounding] sea resounding <i>1609</i>. See note on
I. i. 15 l. 6.</p>

<p>II. xii. 30 l. 6. pleasaunt] peasaunt <i>1596</i>. See note on II. v. 29 l. 5.</p>

<p>II. xii. 39 l. 8. vpstarting] vpstaring <i>1590</i>. I. ix. 22 l. 3 and VI. xi.
27 l. 4 favour <i>1590</i>.</p>

<p>II. xii. 43 l. 5. Nought feard their force] they <i>conj. ed.</i> This correction
gives the desired meaning, ‘They had no fear of force.’ Those who defend
the text take ‘feard’ to mean ‘frightened’, and ‘their’ to refer to the beasts.
(I find that my conjecture has been anticipated by Church and others.)</p>

<p>II. xii. 52 l. 9. See note on I. ii. 29 l. 2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510"></a>[Pg 510]</span></p>

<p>III. i. 47 l. 7. which] that <i>1590</i>. The correction is due to ‘that’ in l. 8.</p>

<p>III. i. 56 l. 8. <i>Basciomani</i>] <i>Bascimano</i> <i>1590</i>. In Spenser’s day the
correct form was <i>basciamano</i> or <i>basciamani</i>, the latter not being plural of the
former, but an independent formation of verb stem + plural noun, like Fr.
<i>porte-montres</i>. Ordinarily it would be fair to credit Spenser with a knowledge
of the right Italian form. Yet in this place the <i>Bascimano</i> of <i>1590</i> has clearly
been corrected: a fresh corruption in an author’s correction is not highly
probable; and I am accordingly disposed to think that Spenser really coined
<i>Basciomani</i> as a substantival use of the phrase <i>bascio le mani</i>. Cf. the familiar
Spanish <i>bezo los manos</i>.</p>

<p>III. ii. 4 l. 1. <i>Guyon</i>] <i>Redcrosse MS. corr. in Malone 615.</i> See Introduction,
p. vii.</p>

<p>III. ii. 8 l. 5. Which I to proue] Which to proue, I <i>1590</i>. See note

<p>III. ii. 30 l. 5. in her warme bed her dight] her in her warme bed dighte
<i>1590</i>. See note on I. v. 7 l. 9.</p>

<p>III. ii. 49 l. 7. a earthen] an earthen <i>1609</i>. Spenser may have intended
to pronounce ‘yearthen’. N. E. D. describes the <i>y</i>-form of ‘earth’ as going
down to the sixteenth century, though no <i>y</i>-forms are quoted under ‘earthen’.
In Northern dialect, with which Spenser was familiar, ‘a’ takes the place of
‘an’ even before a vowel. If the quartos are right, this is another archaism
unfamiliar to <i>1609</i>.</p>

<p>III. iii. 6 l. 1. auisd] aduis’d <i>1609</i>. See note on IV. ii. 22.</p>

<p>III. iii. 15 l. 3. <i>1609</i> makes ‘businesse’ three syllables, and then seeks
to avoid the trisyllabic foot. See note on I. i. 15 l. 6.</p>

<p>III. iii. 44 l. 5. See note on I. ii. 29 l. 2.</p>

<p>III. iii. 50 l. 9. See Introduction, p. xviii.</p>

<p>III. iii. 53 l. 3. Evidently an author’s correction; but the reason for the
change is obscure.</p>

<p>III. iv. 39 l. 9. sith we no more shall meet] till we againe may meet <i>1590</i>.
Spenser has remembered, or been reminded, that <i>Cymoent</i> is a heathen goddess.</p>

<p>III. iv. 40 l. 6. <i>1611</i> modernizes to ‘ielly’d blood’.</p>

<p>III. iv. 59 l. 5. See note on I. v. 7 l. 9.</p>

<p>III. v. Arg. 4. <i>sownd</i>] <i>swound</i> <i>1609</i>. ‘Sownd’ is one of the rarer
spellings of the multiform ‘swound’, ‘swoune’, &amp;c. At VI. i. 34 l. 2 we
find ‘sound’ (= swound) in both <i>1596</i> and <i>1609</i>.</p>

<p>III. v. 5 l. 5. A] And <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>. ‘And’, though defensible, is
probably due to ‘And’ in l. 6.</p>

<p>III. v. 37 l. 6. follow] followd <i>1590</i> should have been recorded in footnote.</p>

<p>III. v. 40 l. 4. their loues sweet teene] their sweet loues teene <i>1590</i>.
Spenser transposed, either for rhythm, or to bring out the oxymoron ‘sweet
teene’. Cf. note on I. v. 7 l. 9.</p>

<p>III. v. 50 l. 8. To him, and to all] To him and all <i>1609</i>. See note on
I. i. 15 l. 6.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511"></a>[Pg 511]</span></p>

<p>III. V. 51 l. 9. to] it <i>1611</i>.</p>

<p>III. v. 52 l. 6. The punctuation of the quartos connects ‘admire’ with
‘In gentle Ladies brest’; but this leaves ‘and bounteous race’ without
construction.</p>

<p>III. v. 53 l. 3. Realmes] Reames <i>1590</i>. So in V. vii. 23 ll. 6, 8, 9
‘realme’ rhymes with ‘extreame’ and ‘dreame’.</p>

<p>III. vi. 6 l. 5. his beames] his hot beames <i>1609</i>. See on I. v. 23 l. 8
and Introduction, p. xvii.</p>

<p>III. vi. 12 l. 2. The rhyme is imperfect, but I find no authority for
reading ‘aspect’.</p>

<p>III. vi. 26 l. 4. both farre and nere <i>om. 1590</i>. <i>1596</i> here completes
a line left imperfect in <i>1590</i>, which makes it possible than Spenser may have
intended to complete other broken lines, such as II. iii. 26 l. 9; II. viii. 55
l. 9.</p>

<p>III. vi. 39 l. 1. <i>1611</i> reads ‘and all’, to avoid the trisyllabic foot. See

<p>III. vii. 9 l. 3. two] to <i>conj. Hughes</i>. Morris reports ‘to’ from <i>1596</i>:
not so in copies examined. See also I. vi. 47 l. 8 and note there.</p>

<p>III. vii. 13 l. 6. had] hath <i>1590</i>. The notes of Todd and Morris
imply that some copies of <i>1596</i> also read ‘hath’. If so, it should be
adopted as the better reading.</p>

<p>III. vii. 22 l. 4. Monstrous mishapt] Monstrous, mishapt <i>1590</i>. Cf.
I. i. 9 l. 6; 1. x. 7 l. 8.</p>

reappears in III. xi.</p>

<p>III. viii. 30 l. 3. frory] frowy <i>1590</i>, <i>1596</i>. The reading of <i>1609</i> is
established by comparison with III. viii. 35 l. 2. ‘Frowie’ occurs in <i>S. C.</i>
(<i>July</i> III); but it means ‘musty’.</p>

<p>III. viii. 46 l. 9. vnworthy] vnworthy’ <i>1590</i>. 49 l. 2 T’haue] To

copies examined.</p>

l. 8 and Introduction, p. xviii.</p>

<p>III. xi. 4 ll. 4 and 9. These two transpositions support each other, the
first being made for grammar, the second for rhythm. See note on I.
v. 7 l. 9.</p>

<p>III. xi. 12 l. 1. singultes] singulfes <i>1590</i>, <i>1596</i>. This word occurs again
in <i>F. Q.</i> V. vi. 13, <i>Colin Clout</i> 168, <i>Tears of the Muses</i> 232; and in all four
places is spelt with ‘f’ in the original editions. We must suppose, either
that the printers made the same mistake four times, or that Spenser misspelt
a word with whose Latin form he must have been quite familiar. Neither
alternative is acceptable; but I find the second incredible.</p>

<p>III. xi. 19 l. 9. death] life <i>conj. Jortin</i>. Jortin’s emendation gives the
sense required; yet Spenser was capable of writing ‘death’. Cf. Introduction,
p. ix.</p>

<p>III. xi 22 l. 8. See note on I. v. 7 l. 9.</p>

<p>III. xi. 23 l. 2. Inglorious, beastlike <i>1611</i>, to avoid the trisyllabic foot.
See note on I. i. 15 l. 6.</p>

<p>III. xi. 26 1. 7. See note on I. ii. 29 l. 2.</p>

<p>III. xi. 39 l. 8. Stag <i>conj. Jortin</i>: Hag <i>1590 &amp;c.</i> In support of Jortin’s
emendation Upton quotes Natalis Comes, <i>Mythologia</i>, iv. 10 ‘Fertur hic
deus [<i>i.e.</i> Apollo] in varias formas ob amores fuisse mutatus, in leonem,
in <i>cervum</i>, in accipitrem’. As the chapter deals with Apollo, and mentions
Hyacinth, Coronis, &amp;c., it is clear that Spenser had been reading it, and
Jortin’s emendation is irresistible. (Spenser would have written ‘an Hag’,
not ‘a Hag’.)</p>

<p>III. xi. 47 l. 9. heauen bright] heauens hight <i>conj. Church</i>. But
identical rhymes are not infrequent in this particular place in a stanza. Yet
the possibility of parablepsy lowers the authority of the quartos in such
cases. The printers would be peculiarly liable to this error in this place if,
in Spenser’s manuscript, the Alexandrine overflowed into the eighth line of
the stanza. (Church spells ‘heuens’, following <i>1590</i>).</p>

<p>III. xii. 12 l. 6. wingyheeld] winged heeld <i>1590</i>. The change seems to
have been made for euphony. See note on I. v. 7 l. 9.</p>

<p>III. xii. 18 l. 8. hony-lady. ‘Hony-laden’ is a tempting suggestion of
Upton’s, and Morris adopts it.</p>

<p>III. xii. 26 l. 7. with that Damozell] by the Damozell <i>1590</i>. According
to <i>1596</i> the Damozell is <i>Amoret</i>, according to <i>1590 Britomart</i>.</p>

<p>III. xii. 34 l. 4. her] him <i>1590</i>, <i>1596</i>. Comparison with the variants in
stanza 42 suggests some oblivion in Spenser’s mind of the sex of his
Championess.</p>

<p>III. xii. 43 to 45. On these stanzas see Introduction, p. xvi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513"></a>[Pg 513]</span></p>

<p>IV. ii. 22 l. 7. aduizing] auising <i>1609</i>. For ‘aduize’ = observe cf. II. ix.
38 l. 3. Similarly we find ‘adward’ <i>1596</i>, but ‘award’ <i>1609</i>; conversely
‘dis-auentrous’ <i>1596</i>, ‘disaduentrous’ <i>1609</i>. Todd quotes from Sir
T. More, ‘Whoso well aduise her visage, &amp;c.’</p>

<p>IV. iii. 43 l. 5. quite age] quiet-age <i>Morris</i>. Morris’s reading (originally
suggested to Jortin by a friend) is very plausible, though the word does not
occur elsewhere in <i>F. Q.</i></p>

<p>IV. iv. 1 l. 4. minds] lines <i>16(11)-12-13</i>. Morris reports ‘liues <i>1609</i>’:
not so in genuine copies examined. See Bibliographical Note.</p>

<p>IV. iv. 2 l. 3. als] els <i>1596</i>. I now think that <i>1596</i> is right. The
proposition illustrated is twofold:—(1) ‘For enmitie, that of no ill proceeds,
But of occasion, with th’occasion ends’; (2) ‘And friendship, which
a faint affection breeds Without regard of good, dyes like ill grounded seeds’.
Reading ‘As als’ we have two illustrations of this twofold proposition.
Reading ‘As els’ we have an independent illustration of each of its parts.
For ‘As els’ cf. the second letter to Harvey:—‘For, why a Gods name,
may not we, as else the Greeks, &amp;c.’</p>

<p>IV. iv. 8 l. 2. <i>Ferrau</i>] <i>Ferrat</i> <i>1596</i>. Called <i>Ferraugh</i> in IV. ii. 4;
Ferraù in Ariosto, O. F. i. 14. Spenser mentions <i>Ferragh</i> as an Irish name
in the ‘<i>Vue</i>’.</p>

<p>IV. iv. 17 l. 4. maiden-headed] satyr-headed <i>conj. Church</i>, referring to
III. vii. 30 l. 6. In the Bodleian copy of Church’s edition is a note by Mr.
G. L. Way, the former owner: ‘Perhaps <i>Maidenheaded Shield</i> may mean
“the shield of him who was one of the Knights of Maidenhead”—see st. 22.’</p>

<p>IV. iv. 24 l. 1. beamlike] Upton reports that one of his quartos had
‘brauelike’, the other ‘beamlike’.</p>

<p>IV. v. 4 l. 4. <i>Lemno</i>] <i>Lemnos</i> <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>IV. vi. 46 l. 5. who] whom <i>16(11)-12-13</i>. Morris reports ‘whom

<p>IV. vii. 12 I. l. caytiue] captiue <i>conj. Collier</i>. But Spenser used the adj.
‘caytiue’ in this sense in I. vii. 19 l. 3; I. ix. 11 l. 9.</p>

<p>IV. x. 8 l. 8. Upton reports that one of his quartos had ‘<i>his</i>’, the other
‘<i>this</i>’.</p>

<p>IV. x. 23 ll. 2, 8. The words ‘ghesse’ and ‘bee’ are transposed in
all copies examined except <i>4<sup>o</sup> Art. Seld. S. 22</i> in the Bodleian and <i>C. 12.
h. 17, 18</i> in the British Museum. The correction was evidently made as the
sheets went through the press. See Introduction, p. xix. <i>16(11)-12-13</i>
reads ‘I ghesse’.</p>

<p>IV. x. 27 l. 1. <i>Hyllus</i> <i>1596</i>: <i>Hylus</i> <i>1609</i>. Spenser evidently means
<i>Hylas</i>. There was a Hyllus, son of Hercules and Deianeira; but it is
unlikely that Spenser confused the two, for he has <i>Hylas</i> rightly in a similar
context, III. xii. 7.</p>

<p>IV. x. 35 ll. 5, 6.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>In this difficult passage two lines of interpretation are offered:—(1) taking
‘hell’ as sb. and ‘quight’ as vb., ‘And hell requite them,’ <i>i.e.</i> punish the
elements by reducing all to chaos: (2) taking ‘hell’ as vb. and ‘quight’ as
advb., ‘And cover them (<i>i.e.</i> the lands) quite.’ The second explanation
involves a difficult parenthesis of ‘And fire deuoure the ayre’: ‘hell’ does
not occur elsewhere in <i>F. Q.</i> as a verb, even in the form ‘hele’, though
‘vnhele’ = uncover is found in II. xii. 64 l. 8; hence it has been proposed to
read ‘mell’ = confuse. But the first line of interpretation seems the more
satisfactory.</p>

<p>IV. xi. 4 l. 6. seuen] three <i>Malone 616</i> and <i>G. 11557</i> in B. M. All
other copies of <i>1596</i> ‘seuen’. This is another instance of correction at press.
See above on IV. x. 23. <i>1609</i> reads ‘three’. I cannot say which reading
represents the poet’s second thought.</p>

<p>IV. xi. 34 l. 5. Grant] Guant <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>: <i>corr. Child</i>. ‘Grant’ is for
Granta, <i>i.e.</i> the Cam, as Upton noted.</p>

changes of construction are not uncommon when a clause intervenes as here.</p>

<p>V. iv. 36 l. 8. Ere long their Queene her selfe, halfe like a man] selfe halfe,
<i>1596</i>: self, arm’d <i>1609</i>. <i>1609</i> may be right; ‘halfe’ in <i>1596</i> may have been
repeated by parablepsy from ‘selfe’: the punctuation of <i>1596</i> points to that.</p>

<p>V. iv. 37 l. 1. neare] newe <i>conj. Church</i>. 3 so few] to feare <i>conj.
Collier</i>. Imperfect rhymes are not rare in <i>F. Q.</i>, but scarcely in this form;
here there is no assonance. Nor does this seem to be one of the ‘substitutions’
discussed in Introduction, p. viii. Of conjectures, Church’s is the best.</p>

<p>V. iv. 37 l. 6. there] their <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>V. iv. 39 l. 3. So cruell doale amongst her maides diuide] ... doile ... dauide
<i>1596</i>. There are two words ‘dole’ in Spenser, (<i>a</i>) portion, (<i>b</i>) mourning.
This is (<i>a</i>): for the phrase cf. Shakespeare, 2 <i>Hen. IV</i>, 1. i. 169, ‘That in
the dole of blows your son might drop.’ Spenser does not elsewhere use
‘dole’ in sense (<i>a</i>); in sense (<i>b</i>) it is common in <i>F. Q.</i>, and is spelt ‘dole’
or ‘doole’. The spelling ‘doile’ (Fr. <i>deuil</i>) belonged rather to sense (<i>b</i>), but
no sixteenth century instance is quoted in N. E. D. It is not impossible that
Spenser wrote ‘doile’ in sense (<i>a</i>), intending a play upon the two meanings.
But more probably ‘a’ and ‘i’ have simply been interchanged, as <i>1609</i> takes
it. (<i>1596</i> generally has ‘deuide’; but ‘diuide’ also occurs.)</p>

<p>V. iv. 48 l. 7. yesterday] yeester day <i>1596</i>. Morris keeps ‘yeester’;
but Spenser has ‘yester’ elsewhere, and a misprint is probable. The latter
part of this canto, as these notes show, is unusually full of such difficulties.</p>

<p>V. v. 18 l. 4. to’a] The apostrophation shows synezesis, though the
vowel is not omitted.</p>

<p>V. v. 38 l. 8. And, though (vnlike)] And, though vnlike <i>1596</i>. The
meaning is, ‘And even if (as is unlikely) they should last, &amp;c.’</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Church would transpose ‘houres’ and ‘dayes’, ‘weekes’ and ‘moneths’.
Spenser may have meant that she reckoned in months instead of weeks to
make the time look shorter; <i>e.g.</i> said three months instead of twelve weeks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516"></a>[Pg 516]</span>
dwelling on the numeral and wilfully ignoring the noun. But this is one of
those subtleties in which we feel the difference between Spenser and Shakespeare.

defend ‘things’ as genitive. Church’s conjecture is preferable to that. But
there is no real objection to taking ‘things’ as nom. pl.</p>

<p>V. vi. 25 l. 9. nights] Knight’s <i>conj. Church</i>. This conjecture, like
others of Church’s, is rather plausible to common sense than convincingly
Spenserian.</p>

<p>V. vi. 26 l. 5. Ne lesse] Sense requires ‘Ne more’; but see note on
II. v. 12.</p>

<p>V. vi. 29 l. 2. armed] arm’d <i>1596</i>. See note on V. iii. 11.</p>

<p>V. vi. 33 l. 7. auenge] reuenge <i>16(11)-12-13</i>. Morris and Grosart report
‘reuenge <i>1609</i>’: not so in genuine copies examined.</p>

<p>V. vii. 6 l. 9. her] From stanza 15 it appears that ‘her’ should have
been ‘his’. But the mistake may be Spenser’s.</p>

<p>V. vii. 13 l. 5. to robe] to be <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>V. vii. 23 l. 6. See note on III. v. 53 l. 3.</p>

But these are at the end of lines, where the number of syllables is indifferent.</p>

<p>V. x. 3 l. 6. <i>Armericke</i>] <i>Americke conj. Todd</i>. Todd’s conjecture is
highly probable. Otherwise we must take <i>Armericke</i> to mean Armoric, <i>i.e.</i>
of Brittany.</p>

<p>V. x. 6 l. 4. See note on I. i. 15 l. 6.</p>

<p>V. x. 18 l. 8. fastnesse] safenesse <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>V. x. 23 l. 4. threating] threatening <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>V. x. 24 l. 5. farewell open field] well fare <i>conj. edd.</i> needlessly: ‘farewell’
here = welcome.</p>

<p>V. xi. 5 l. 9. have riue] not riue <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>V. xi. 40 l. 6 is a very effective tetrameter as it stands. The reading of
<i>16(11)-12-13</i> is not, I think, authentic.</p>

<p>V. xi. 41 l. 6. Upton’s correction had already been made in Hughes’s
second edition.</p>

<p>V. xi. 54 l. 9. corruptfull] corrupted <i>16(11)-12-13</i>. Morris and Grosart
report ‘corrupted <i>1609</i>’: not so in genuine copies examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517"></a>[Pg 517]</span></p>

<p>V. xi. 61 l. 7. meed] hyre <i>conj. Church</i>. But see Introduction, p. viii.
The reading ‘meed’ in this stanza makes the rhyme-scheme <i>ababbcacc</i>.</p>

<p>V. xi. 61 l. 8. froward] forward <i>1596</i>. The sense requires ‘froward’.
For the distinction between the two words cf. II. ii. 38; and for a similar
confusion between them VI. x. 24 1. 7.</p>

<p>V. xii. 14 l. 8. steale] steele <i>1609</i>. But ‘steale’ here = handle.</p>

<p>VI. Proem 6 l. 9. name] fame <i>edd.</i> See note on V. ii. 46 l. 9.</p>

<p>VI. i. 8 l. 7. wretched] wicked <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>VI. i. 37 l. 5. pot-shares] pot-shards <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>VI. i. 34 l. 2. For ‘sound’ = swound cf. III. v. Arg.</p>

<p>VI. ii. 3 ll. 3, 4. ‘Eyes’ and ‘eares’ ought of course to have been
transposed. But there is no evidence that the error is not Spenser’s.
And this must raise a doubt as to whether the printer is responsible for
‘euery act and deed, that he did say’ in l. 2.</p>

<p>VI. ii. 39 l. 2. implements] ornaments <i>1609</i>. This change looks less
like a printer’s error than an editorial improvement.</p>

<p>VI. iii. 12 l. 7. saue] salue <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>VI. iii. 21 l. 8. default] assault <i>conj. Collier</i>. See note on V. ii. 46 l. 9.
But Collier is very likely right here. The chance of parablepsy, always present
in such cases, is here unusually strong with ‘assault’ &gt; &lt; ‘default’.</p>

<p>VI. iii. 23 l. 2. <i>Serena</i>] <i>Cristina</i> <i>1596 Bodl.</i> All the B. M. copies
‘<i>Serena</i>’. A striking instance of correction made during the printing of the
sheets. See Introduction, p. xix.</p>

<p>VI. iii. 24 l. 5. in vaine <i>om. 16(11)-12-13</i>. These words, which make
the line a hexameter, are not omitted in any of the genuine <i>1609</i> copies
examined. See Bibliographical Note.</p>

<p>VI. iii. 35 l. 3. Which] That <i>1596 Bodl.</i> The four B. M. copies have
the superior reading ‘Which’. The change was evidently made at press to
avoid the repetition of ‘that’.</p>

<p>VI. iii. 37 l. 9. did for her] for her did <i>1596 Bodl.</i> Again the four
B. M. copies have the superior reading: change made at press for euphony.
Mr. Ostler points out that the corrections in stanzas 23, 35, and 37 all occur
in the outer forme of signature B b, which explains the agreement of the B. M.
copies. Had the corrections been on both sides of the sheet, there would
probably (he thinks) have been a further dispersal of various readings.</p>

<p>VI. iii. 42 ll. 4, 7. The rhyme-words have been transposed in <i>1596</i>.</p>

<p>VI. iv. 4 l. 7. stroke] strokes <i>1609</i> should have been recorded in the
footnote.</p>

<p>VI. iv. 16 l. 8. hurts] hurt <i>16(11)-12-13</i>. The latter reading is more
grammatical, but is not found in any of the genuine <i>1609</i> copies examined.</p>

<p>VI. v. Arg. 1. <i>Matilda</i>] <i>Serena</i> <i>corr. Hughes rightly</i>. The confusion is
due to the <i>Matilde</i> of Canto iv; but it is Spenser’s own.</p>

<p>VI. v. 39 l. 3. full gladly they did take in glee] gree <i>1609</i>. The reading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518"></a>[Pg 518]</span>
of <i>1609</i> is supported by V. vi. 21 l. 7. On the other hand, the alliteration
favours ‘glee’; and we find ‘nor for gold nor glee’ in I. ix. 32 l. 7.</p>

<p>VI. vi. Arg. 3. <i>He</i> refers to <i>Arthur</i>; but no emendation is possible.</p>

<p>VI. vi. 4 l. 4. Of] In <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>VI. vi. 16 l. 1. the] th’ <i>1596</i>. See note on V. iii. 11.</p>

<p>VI. vii. 3 l. 7. armed] arm’d <i>1596</i>. See note on V. iii. 11.</p>

<p>VI. vii. 15 l. 9. yearned] earned <i>1609</i>. See note on II. iii. 46 l. 9.</p>

<p>VI. vii. 49 l. 9. Words] Swords <i>conj. Church</i>. The sense, as often,
favours Church’s conjecture; but the alliteration favours the text.</p>

<p>VI. viii. 50 l. 4. what they ought] what shee ought <i>1609</i>, taking ‘ought’
= owned. For the converse see note on II. viii. 40 l. 4.</p>

<p>VI. ix. 28 l. 6. the heauens] th’heauens <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>. See note on
V. iii. 11.</p>

<p>VI. x. 2 l. 9. in] on <i>1596</i>. Spenser is apparently thinking of the Latin
proverb ‘in portu nauigare’; yet it does not mean exactly what he desires to
convey here. In Terence, <i>Andria</i>, i. 3. 22 ego in portu nauigo = I am out
of danger: Spenser means ‘never reaching the land’. Possibly <i>1596</i> is right,
and we have here a nautical phrase that has been lost.</p>

<p>VI. x. 24 l. 7. froward] forward <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>: <i>corr. 16(11)-12-13</i>. The
reading ‘froward’, though not found in any of the genuine <i>1609</i> copies
examined, is clearly right, as is shown by the Gloss on <i>S. C.</i> for <i>April</i>, where
the Graces are thus described:—‘And Boccace saith, that they be painted
naked ... the one hauing her backe toward us, and her face fromwarde, as
proceeding from us; the other two toward us, &amp;c.’</p>

<p>VI. x. 36 l. 6. And hewing off his head, it presented <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>:
(he) it presented <i>edd.</i> Though Spenser is not above this kind of bad
rhyme, I do not find that he ever accents ‘présented’.</p>

<p>VI. x. 44. The reading and punctuation of <i>1609</i> (which makes a long
parenthesis of ll. 3-7) are, of course, much more logical; but not therefore
more Spenserian.</p>

<p>VI. xii. 12 l. 8. loos] praise <i>1609</i>. We may have here an authentic
after-thought of Spenser’s. He may, on reflection, have disliked the
collocation of ‘losse’ and ‘loos’. If so, this line should be added to the
instances cited in the Introduction, p. xviii. But it is equally probable that
the editor of <i>1609</i>, failing to recognize the obsolescent ‘loos’—which nevertheless
occurs in Puttenham—took it for a printer’s repetition of ‘losse’, and
corrected accordingly.</p>

<p>VI. xii. 41 l. 3. clearest <i>1596</i>, <i>1609</i>: cleanest <i>Hughes</i>. Hughes’s
conjecture, though not supported by any of the old copies examined, is
nevertheless very probably right; for the stanza is carelessly printed in <i>1596</i>,
as the variants recorded in the footnotes show. But Spenser has too many
imperfect rhymes to allow us to consider the emendation certain.</p>

<p>VII. vi. 38 l. 2. wealths] wealth <i>Hughes &amp;c.</i> The plural may be
defended as = different kinds of wealth; but the misprint is easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519"></a>[Pg 519]</span></p>

<p>VII. vii. 9 l. 7. <i>kindes</i>] <i>kinde</i> <i>Morris after Upton</i>; and so Chaucer calls
it in the <i>Parlement of Foules</i> 316.</p>

<p>VII. vii. 10 l. 4. mores] more <i>Hughes</i>. Upton defends ‘mores’, as =
roots, plants; and most editions, and the N. E. D., accept this. Nor did
‘mores’ offend the editor of <i>16(11)-12-13</i>; so that it is probably right,
though I do not find that ‘more’ elsewhere ever means anything but root,
or stock.</p>

<p>VII. vii. 28 l. 3. did <i>om. 16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>VII. viii. 1 l. 7. to cast] and cast <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>VII. viii. 2 l. 9. Church’s conjecture (made also by Upton) makes
Spenser distinguish between Sabaoth = hosts and Sabbath = rest. The
distinction exists in Hebrew; but it seems to spoil the point of the stanza
to suppose that Spenser drew it here. No inference can be based on the
varying spellings of ‘Sabaoth’ in <i>1609</i>, <i>16(11)-12-13</i>.</p>

<p>Of the Letter to Raleigh, Commendatory Verses, and Dedicatory Sonnets,
only the verses by W. R. and Hobynoll are found in <i>1596 Bodl.</i>, or in
Mr. Cannan’s <i>1609</i>, where they are printed in their original position at the
end of Book III. The rest of this additional matter is here reproduced from
<i>1590 Bodl.</i>, with which <i>C. 12. h. 17</i> of B. M. agrees. It was evidently
thrown together in some haste; there are several dislocations and omissions
in the other B. M. copy of <i>1590</i>. The Bodleian folios omit the last two
sonnets; the verses by W. R. and Hobynoll they print twice over.</p>
